<span style="font-size: 1.25rem">**Flag Fun**</span> is a web application built with with **React** , **HTML**, and **CSS**.
<br>

The objective of this project was to build a web application using **React**, rather than using the old school methods for building the entire page with HTML and Javascript.
<br>

<span style="font-size: 1.4rem"> **React**</span> is essentially a javascript library for building **User Interfaces**. However using **React** makes the considerably less tedious. While using **React** we just need to design the views for each state in our web application and **React** will efficiently update and render just the right components when the data changes.
<br><br>

## **Project Detail**

**Flag Fun** is a fun **User Interaction App** wherein users can interact either by providing manual input as a **flag emoji** in the input bar or can select from the **emojis** available on the page. Based on the user input appropriate **country's** name is displayed denoting the country of the input flag emoji.
<br>

To handle the state of the input flag, we used **React's Hook API**
[useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html).
<br>
To implement the **DOM** functionalities [React DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) is used.
